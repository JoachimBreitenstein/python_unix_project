Python unix project notes: 
- probably a good idea to make a func_file from which we import functions to main script 


program is run by: 
project_main.py people.db

data handeling: 
infile = "people.db"



1. Is the age and gender distribution normal/sensible in the database? A yes/no answer is not good enough. (DONE)
- do string search for age and gender in each line and add match to respective list 
- make count_dicts for age and gender from lists 

2. At what age does the men become fathers first time (max age, min age, average age)? (DONE)
- make "father_dict" and calculate max, min and avg by iterating over values 
- stateful parsing over file --> write into new file --> extract all ages from new file and calculate max, min and avg age

3. Is the distribution of first-time fatherhood age normal/sensible? A yes/no answer is not good enough. (DONE)
- find matches from father_file with only one children match --> make count_dict 

4. At what age does the women become mothers first time (max age, min age, average age)? (DONE)
- same problem as 3)

5. Is the distribution of first-time motherhood age normal/sensible? A yes/no answer is not good enough. (DONE)

6. How many men and women do not have children (in percent)? (DONE)

7. What is the average age difference between the parents (with a child in common obviously)? (DONE)

8. How many people has at least one grandparent that is still alive? A person is living if he/she is in the database. State the number both in percent and as a real number.

9. For those who have cousins, what is the average number of cousins?

10. Is the firstborn likely to be male or female?
11. How many men/women (percentage) have children with more than one woman/man?
12. Do tall people marry (or at least get children together)? To answer that, calculate the percentages of tall/tall, tall/normal, tall/short, normal/normal, normal/short, and short/short couples. Decide your own limits for tall, normal and short, and if they are the same for men and women.
13. Do tall parents get tall children?
14. Do fat people marry (or at least get children together)? To answer that, calculate the percentages of fat/fat, fat/normal, fat/slim, normal/normal, normal/slim, and slim/slim couples. Decide your own limits for fat, normal and slim. Calculate the BMI, and let that be the fatness indicator.
15. Using the knowledge of blood group type inheritance, are there any children in the database where you can safely say that at least one of the parents are not the real parent. If such children exists, make a list of them. In the report you must discuss how you determine that the parent(s) of the child are not the "true" parents.
16. Make a list of fathers who can donate blood to their sons. The list must identify must the father and the son(s) and their blood type. You must write the length of the list in the report, together with the number of fathers and the number of sons.
17. Make a list of persons who can donate blood to at least one of their grandparents. The list must identify must the person, the grandparent(s) and their blood type. You must write the length of the list in the report, together with the number of grandchildren and the number of grandparents.
